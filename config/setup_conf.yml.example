# Default configurations
# The values defined here will be used as default for all environments (development, test,
# production). You can also define specific configurations for each environment to override
# the defaults. To do that, copy the parameters you want to override and paste them inside
# the environment you want. These environments are commented in the end of this file.

# Configurations for each environment
# You can find below the sections for each environment available.
# Uncomment the lines from one of them to define specific configurations for that environment.
# You can copy any of the parameters from the default section and override them here.
# Remember to copy the entire sections: if you want to override "site_email" and
# "default_space_name", you must do something like:
#
# development:
#   site_email: "override the email"
#   default_space_name: "new name"
#
# Also remember to maintain the file indented with 2 spaces. The YML file must be well
# formatted to be valid.
